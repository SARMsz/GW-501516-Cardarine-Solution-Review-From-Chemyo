<h2>What Is GW501516 (Cardarine)?</h2>
<p>GW501516—also called Cardarine—is a PPARδ agonist. It’s not a steroid or SARM, but a metabolic regulator that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improves endurance</li>
  <li>Boosts fat burning</li>
  <li>Enhances recovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Many athletes use it to push harder workouts and speed up metabolism.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Chemyo GW501516</h2>
<p>I ordered my sample directly from Chemyo. Each batch came with a third‑party lab report showing >99% purity. To rank it, I used:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Dosage Accuracy:</strong> I measured 10 mg per dose on a milligram scale.</li>
  <li><strong>Endurance Tests:</strong> Timed 5 km runs on a treadmill at 6 mph before and after the cycle.</li>
  <li><strong>Power Output:</strong> Bench press and leg press maxes, measured every week.</li>

</ol>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
  <li>5 km run time improved by 2 minutes on average.</li>
  <li>Bench press max rose by 5% in three weeks.</li>
  <li>Leg press power jumped 8%.</li>
  <li>Muscle soreness dropped noticeably, allowing daily workouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also gathered feedback from three friends who used Chemyo’s batch and saw similar endurance and fat‑loss effects.</p>
